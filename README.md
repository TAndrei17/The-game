# The-game

'Tic-Tac-Toe' is a simple game for two persons on one field. 

It is my first project as a frontend-developer. My purpose was to apply my skills and knowlege which i received in the process of self-studying at an online school 'Hexlet' for first 4 month.

- Created my first npm-package and installed eslint/prettier;
- Created all HTML/CSS/JS code myself without copy & past;
- Polished my skills of Git/GitHub and command line.
