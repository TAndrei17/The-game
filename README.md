# The-game. Tic-Tac-Toe. Option 1

['Tic-Tac-Toe' is a simple game for two people on one field.](https://tandrei17.github.io/tic-tac-toe_option-first/ "To GitHub pages")

It is my first project as a front-end developer. My purpose was to apply my skills and knowledge which I received in the process of self-studying at an online school ['Hexlet'](https://hexlet.io/my "Hexlet's page") for the first 4 months.

- Created my first npm-package and installed eslint/prettier;
- Created all HTML/CSS/JS code myself without copy & paste;
- Polished my skills on Git/GitHub and the command line.

The main idea of the code is to use the attributes of the 'td' DOM-elements to parse and find the winner. At the moment of formation of the playing field, each playing cell receives a unique attribute 'cellNum' - a number passed as a string. At the moment of clicking on the game cell, the attribute value is retrieved from the tag and passed to the array for processing and finding the winner.
